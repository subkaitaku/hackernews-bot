This program uses the Hacker News API to translate titles in DeppL and post them to the LINE channel.<br>
When you actually run it, please use DEEPL_API_KEY/LINE_CHANNEL_TOKEN/LINE_USER_ID in the .env.<br>
I develop using the `Dev container` and haven't set the container configuration for production yet.<br>
